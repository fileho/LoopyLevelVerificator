# Solver for the Loopy game

A brute force C++ solver for the Loopy game.

It was used primarily for developing new levels and asserting that those levels are solvable. 
It outputs the shortest found solution and the number of iterations required to solve the level.

It is a brute force since we want to find the shortest solution. Otherwise, heuristics might be useful.
